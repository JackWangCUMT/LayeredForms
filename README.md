# LayeredForms

A .NET components that provide the ability to create forms with PNG transparent images and the addition of child controls on it using [layered windows] with [UpdateLayeredWindow]. it was original part of [BorderSkin].

# Getting Started
You will need Visual Studio to work with the project, I use Visual Studio 2013 but I think previous versions can work too.
Since LayeredForms depends on [WinApiWrappers], you will need to clone it also

    git clone https://github.com/mohamedkomalo/LayeredForms
    git clone https://github.com/mohamedkomalo/WinApiWrappers

That's it, just open LayeredForms.sln and build it
